# Finger-counter
This is a simple finger detection and counting program. It takes video input from your webcam and detects fingers in real-time. The program returns the live webcam feed with bounding boxes around the detected fingers, along with the count of fingers detected. To exit the program, press the 'q' or 'esc' button.

While creating this program, I gained insights into the OpenCV module and learned how to use pre-trained AI models for object detection.
